# Background
Eggs are essential commodities in Indonesia with high demand, requiring consistent quality and supply. Traditional egg fertility checks through candling are manual, slow, and prone to inconsistencies. This project introduces an automated system utilizing the FOMO MobileNetV2 algorithm on Raspberry Pi 5 to classify fertile and infertile eggs efficiently and accurately. The solution ensures high-quality egg production while enhancing operational efficiency in poultry farms, supporting Indonesia's egg supply chain sustainability.

### Research Problem Formulation
- Manual candling requires a trained and healthy eyes, making it hard for people who have eye problems.
- A single person can only do one egg at a time, can lead to time problem if the human resources isnâ€™t enough.

### Goals
- Automate the candling process for eggs on a real-time cases  with a low-cost environment.
- Optimize time consume by ensuring a precise and efficient classification.
- Provide a user-friendly system with clear feedback.

### Solutions
- Integrate a Machine Learning (ML) to the concept of candling.
- Use an images that contains an egg in a candling-specific lighting condition.
- Employ a Raspberry Pi 5 to process data and apply ML to do classification.
- Use a monitor to display the information.

## Preparation
### Hardware Component
- **Raspberry Pi 5**: Microcontroller for processing data dan ML classification.
- **Raspberry Pi** Adapter: Powers the Raspberry Pi 5
